# Rat Fighter RPG

This project contains a tiny browser-based RPG written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You control a hero who battles an endless stream of rats. Each victory grants experience and a chance to find items that increase your attack power. When enough experience is gained you level up, restoring health and making the next rat stronger.
